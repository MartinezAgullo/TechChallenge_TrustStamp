    "# Land use and Land Cover Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability of free satellite data has increased its use in several applications in the domains of agriculture, disaster recovery, climate change, urban development, or environmental monitoring can be realized. However, to fully utilize the data for the previously mentioned domains, first satellite images must be processed and transformed into structured semantics. One type of such fundamental semantics is Land Use and Land Cover Classification. The aim of land use and land cover classification is to automatically provide labels describing the represented physical land type or how a land area is used (e.g., residential, industrial)\n",

    "A satellite image dataset for the task of land use and land cover classification was presented in [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8519248). The EuroSAT dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and consists of 27,000 labeled images with a total of 10 different classes listed below where the patches are 64x64 pixels each.\n",

An `nn.Module` contains layers, and a method `forward(input)` that returns the output. Write the `CNN` class to define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) where the first convolutional layer (`conv1`) takes 3 input channels, outputs 16 output channels and has a kernel size of 5. The output of `conv1` is fed into a ReLU followed by a Max-pooling operator. The second convolutional layer in this network (`conv2`) should have 32 filters with a kernel size of 5 followed by a ReLU and a max-pooling operator. The last layer is a fully-connected layer (`fc1`) with 10 output neurons. In this code you should define the `__init__` and `forward` member functions.\n",
